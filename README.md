# Religious Guidances
#### Video Demo:  [CS50x: Religious Guidances](https://youtu.be/lu1TV9Fm-90)
#### Description: 

For my final project, I created a website called `Religious Guidance` where users can get random religious teachings. Growing up in Thailand, where Buddhism has a strong influence, inspired me. I found that religious teachings helped me understand life, feel less suffering, and find more happiness.

On this site, users can choose teachings from either **Buddhism** or **Christianity** and can click a _Continue Random Guidances_ button to get a new random guidance. If the user like the guidance, user can click the _Like_ button in order to like that guidance.
